# The-Saviour
Filter the meteors and be 'The Saviour'
I am CS Peterson. I love coding in Python. Today, I am presenting a new game which I created in Python. And, the game is called 'The Saviour'. I made this game using various modules which I would be revealing at the end. So here is a bit of backstory of the game. After this, I recommend reading the README.pdf which contains a total guide to the game along with a picture. 


BACKSTORY-
A star burst has resulted in meteors which can destroy the Earth. Dr. Anand Maheshwari, an astronaut from India has got the task to prevent the meteors from destroying Earth. His scientist friends, Dr. Mahesh Jadhav and Amandeep Singh, have built such a machine that can filter out the meteors, thus nullifying their effects. They together have fixed the machine to Anand’s spaceship. Now, Anand has got to filter the meteors and prevent the meteors from destroying Earth. However, he can manage losing upto 29 meteors, which won’t cause that damage. However, if he misses 30 or more meteors then, his mission would be unsuccessful and many countries or even continents would be severely damaged, and may also result in Earth’s destruction. Anand, wants you to help him to get over with this dangerous task.
